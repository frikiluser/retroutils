TO-DO list:

Relatively easy:
- Add some mechanism to display detected unlisted (or unknown) nodes.
- Add a simple command line interface using the serial comms to:
  * Configure the nodelist.
  * Display information about the nodes (ie, countdown status and other information to be added).
  * Reset the display via command.
- Connected with the previous, save the nodelist in EEPROM.

Will require some soldering:
- Add a button to reset the display using the touch capability of the TFT screen.

Science fiction by now:
- Actively monitor non-adjacent nodes using LOOP NODE messages.

That last thing would require to become an active DECNET node instead of being just a sniffer.
