This is the README file for the retroutils repository.

This repository contains utilities developed to work with the SIMH 
classic computer simulators. 

INDEX OF UTILITIES

bin2load:	Tool to convert an a.out executable or a memory binary image
		file to the format that the "load" command of the PDP-11
		simulator understands ("paper tape format")

BlinkenServer: Hardware implementation of a "blinkenlights" display for the SIMH pdp11. Contains a GPIO based version
               (to be used with a Raspberry Pi) and a Serial based (to be used with an arduino).

JBlinkenServer:	Software implementation of a "blinkenlights" console for the SIMH pdp-11

simh-patches: Patches for the SIMH pdp-11 simulator to use the blinkenlights stuff. NOT RECOMMENDED. Use my own branch of
              SIMH at github.com/jguillaumes/simh
              
vaxtools: Several VMS utilities (idle process killer, clock adjuster, "mainframe like" hex file dumper.

DecnetListener: Pcap-based sniffer for DECNET hello packets.

DecnetListenerPlus: A little bit more sofisticante DecnetListener, written in C++.

DecnetTFT:     Arduino sketch to drive a ST7735 based TFT display and an ENC28J60 ethernet adapter to monitor
               and display DECNET adjacencies. It works using an Arduino UNO and would probably als work
	       with a Leonardo or Micro (not tested). I personally use a standalone MCU to run it.
               
====

xterm-xresources: .xresources file to make xterm similar to a VT220.
